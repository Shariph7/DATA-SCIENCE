AI(Artificial Intelligence) is the branch of computer science i.e. a agents that are programmed especially to deals with real world problems, thinking, analyzing, Natural Language Processing Capabilities is called Artificial Intelligence.<br>

Machine Learning is the way of making machine Learning from the Data and Statistics and produce the meaningful outcome or prediction based on the data provided to it.<br>
Machine Learning is the Subsets of AI(Artificial Intelligence)<br>
Types of Machine Learning are:<br>
# 1.Supervised learning<br>
# 2.Unservised Leraning<br>
1. Supervised Learning -> The Machine Learning Model in which the labelled data is given to the computer system to predicts the outcome is called Supervised Learning.In this learning model labelled data
is given. The Model is built in which usually there is practice of training 80% labelled data and 20% testing.
