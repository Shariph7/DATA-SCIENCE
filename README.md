# 1. What is Artificial Intelligence?<br>
AI(Artificial Intelligence) is the branch of computer science i.e. a agents that are programmed especially to deals with real world problems, thinking, analyzing, Natural Language Processing Capabilities is called Artificial Intelligence.<br>
# 2. What is Machine Learning?<br>
Machine Learning is the way of making machine Learn from the Data and Statistics and produce the meaningful outcome or prediction based on the data provided to it.<br>
Machine Learning is the Subsets of AI(Artificial Intelligence)<br>
Types of Machine Learning are:<br>

# I. Supervised learningüßë‚Äçüè´<br>
The Machine Learning Model in which the labelled data is given to the computer system to predicts the outcome is called Supervised Learning.In this learning model labelled data
is given. The Model is built in which usually there is practice of training 80% labelled data and 20% testing.The Most commonly used Algorithm are:<br>
a. Regression<br>
b. Classification<br>

# II. Unsupervised Leraningüíª<br>
The Machine Learning Model in which the unlabelled data is given to the Machine and make them learned from the data and to predict the classes of the datapoints. In this model The outcome is predicted
on the basis of cluster.i.e. The data points are divided into different cluster.i.e. Groups for better Clarification.<br>
The Most Commomly used Algorithm are:<br>
a. Decision Tree<br>
b. K-Mean Clustering<br>
c. Hierarchial Clustering<br>
iv. Random Forest<br>

Most Commonly used Machine Learning Algorithm:

# 3. What is Deep Learning?üõú<br>
Deep Learning is the Artificial Neural Network Techniques to solve the complex patterns problems. It is based on the concpets of Human Brain Nerves Systems. It is moslty widely used in Neural Networks
and Gen AI.<br>
Deep Learning is the Substes of the Machine Learning. In this Learning, Unlabelled and Labelled data is given in which labelled data is trained comparatively less than that of Unlabelled data. This 
Technique is also called Semi-Supervised Learning Model.<br>

# 4. RoadMap For Machine Learning Engineer:<br>
1. Mathematics (Probability | Statistics)<br>
2. Programming Language (Python | R)<br>
3. Database (MongoDB | SQL)<br>
4. ML Algorthim<br>
5. Machine learning Libraries (Sklearn, Pytorch, Tensorflow)<br>
6. Deep Learning<br>
7. Data Visualization (Power BI | Tableau)<br>
