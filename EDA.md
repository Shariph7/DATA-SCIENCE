# What is EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)

EDA is a technique used by the data scientits to analyze and investigate data sets and summerize thier main Characteristics, often employing data Visualization Methods.<br>
EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. 
It can also help determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate. Originally developed by American mathematician John Tukey in the 1970s, EDA techniques continue
to be a widely used method in the data discovery process today.<br>
# Why is exploratory data analysis important in data science?
Data scientists can use exploratory analysis to ensure the results they produce are valid and applicable to any desired business outcomes and goals. EDA also helps stakeholders by confirming they are asking the
right questions.<br>
# Types of Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Univariate Non-Graphical<br>
This is simplest form of data analysis, where the data being analyzed consists of just one variable. Since it’s a single variable, it doesn’t deal with causes or relationships. The main purpose of
univariate analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that exist within it.<br>
This can include measures of central tendency (like the mean or median), measures of spread (like the range or standard deviation), and measures of shape (like skewness or kurtosis).<br>
2. Univariate Graphical<br>
Non-graphical methods don’t provide a full picture of the data. Graphical methods are therefore required.<br>
3. Multi Variate Non-Graphical<br>
Multivariate nongraphical: Multivariate data arises from more than one variable. Multivariate non-graphical EDA techniques generally show the relationship between two or more variables of the data through 
cross-tabulation or statistics.<br>
4. Multi Variate Graphical<br>
Multivariate data uses graphics to display relationships between two or more sets of data.<br>
